# DNX Image Format Viewer
A program to open `.dnx` files and transform a image file file into `.dnx`

## About
This project was developed with the purpose of creating a new file format, allowing you to transform standard image files into .dnx files. Keep in mind that this project is not intended to create a necessarily "useful" format, but rather to create a different format that can perhaps be used in future projects.

## Attention!
Keep in mind that some antiviruses consider the program as a risk to your computer. If you want to run `dviewer.exe`, you must disable your antivirus, or add the program to its whitelist.

## How transform a image into a `.dnx` image
